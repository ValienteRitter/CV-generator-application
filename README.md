## What I learned

This project was a great way to strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals, especially managing complex forms and state. At first i really struggled with using states correctly, there were a lot bugs and errors whenever i needed to modify states. But as i practiced more and more, i learned many concepts regarding the state management like:
- Lifting the state up
- Updating objects
- Adding/removing/updating data in array
